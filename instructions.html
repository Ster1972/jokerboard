        <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Jokers - How to Play</p>
        <p>Jokers is a partnership game played with standard playing-cards on boards (either physically or virtually - like this one). It allows extra scope for strategy by giving players a choice of cards to play. Each player has five marbles, and the winners are the first team to move all their marbles from their START area to their HOME areas.
        </p>
        <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Setup</p>      
        <p>Players are divided into two teams - two against two. They pick alternating positions on the board - each player must be between two opponents.
        </p>
        <p>Two standard decks of cards are used, with two jokers in each deck.
        </p>
        <p>Each player has five marbles in their chosen color. Each side of the board has a straight section of 19 units long: there is a corner hole at each end, shared between two adjacent sides, and 17 holes between them. The 8th hole after the corner is the "come out" position for the marbles on that side, and next to it is your "start" area with five holes where your marbles are stored at the start of the game. The 3rd hole after the corner is the entrance to your "home", and branching off at the entrance is a private track of 5 holes, which is your "home", where your marbles end their journey.
        </p>
        <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Deal and playing of cards</p>
        <p>Six cards are dealt to each player. To play a card a player drags a card to the square box. When released all other participants will see the card played. Players take turns in clockwise order.
        </p>
        <p>If you have any card that allows you to move a marble, you must play such a card, even if the move is disadvantageous. However, if you have no cards that enable you to move you may discard one card of your choice without moving and draw a card to replace it. This ends your turn. Discarding without moving normally happens only at the start of the game, when a player has no aces or pictures to move any marble out of the start area.
        </p>
        
        <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Movement of marbles - general rules</p>
        <p>All the marbles begin in their own start areas. From there they move to the neighbouring "come out" hole, and then around the board clockwise. On reaching the entrance to their own "home" a marble may take the branch into its safe "home" track. No marble may ever move into any start or home area other than its own.
        </p>
        <p>In the basic game, except in special circumstances described below, you may only move your own marbles.
        </p>
        <p>You may never land on or pass over a hole occupied by one of your own marbles, but you may pass over or land on other player's marbles. Passing over a marble of a different color has no effect on it, but landing exactly in the hole occupied by a marble of a different color has the following results:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>When a marble lands on an opponent's marble, the opponent's marble is immediately moved back to its start area.</li>
            <li> When a marble lands on a partner's marble, the partner's marble is immediately moved to the entrance of it's "home", provided the partner does not already have a marble there. It is illegal to land on your partner's marble if that partner already has a marble at the entrance to their "home".</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Movement of marbles - effects of individual cards</p>
        <p>In order to move your marble out of your start area, you must play a jack, queen, king, ace (to move it to its "come out" hole) or a joker (to move it to the hole occupied by a marble of a different color anywhere on the main track).
        </p>
        <p>When playing a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 or 10, you move one of your own marbles that is not in your start area forward that number of holes along the track.
        </p>
       <p>When playing an ace, you may either move one of your marbles from your start area to your "come out" hole, or move one of your marbles forward one hole.
       </p>
      <p>When playing a jack, queen or king you may either move one of your marbles from your start area to your "come out" hole, or move one of your marbles forward 10 holes.
      </p>
        <p>When playing an 8, you must move one of your marbles backwards 8 holes. Note: when playing an 8 you are able to passover your own marbles, but may not land in a hole occupied by one of your own marbles.
        </p>
        <p>When playing a 7, you may either move one of your marbles forward 7 holes, or split the 7 between two of your marbles, moving them 1 and 6, 2 and 5 or 3 and 4 holes forwards. Of course the split move can only be made if you have at least two marbles in play.
        </p>
        <p>When you play a joker, you move any one of your marbles (for example one in the start area) into a hole on the main track that is occupied by another player's marble, belonging either to a partner or to an opponent. This has the effect of sending that marble to the entrance of their home or start area respectively, as described above.
        </p>
        <p>You must always use the full value of the card played. For example when playing a 6 you must move a marble forward 6 holes, no less.
        </p>
        <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Endgame</p>
        <p>For a team to win the game, all its marbles must be in their respective home areas. Marbles move along the home tracks in the usual way. Since they cannot land on or pass over each other, the first marble to arrive must eventually be moved all the way to the end of the home track to leave room for the others, the second to the next space behind it and so on.
        </p>
        <p>"Backing in" to the home track is not allowed. In other words, marbles cannot turn into their home track while moving backwards. Also, marbles that are already in their home areas are not allowed to move backwards. 
        </p>
        <p>However, it is legal to use a backward move on the main track as a means to get from start to home. For example: you could use a face-card to move from the start area to "come-out"; use an 8 to move back 8 spaces to the corner (NOT into the home track); use a 4, 5, 6 or 7 to move forward into your home track.
        </p>
        <p>When, and only when, all five of your marbles are in the home (safe) position, occupying the five holes of your home track, you use your turn to move the marbles of your partner, if that player still has playable marbles.
        </p>
        <p>The first team that manages to get all its marbles into their respective home areas wins the game.
        </p>
        <p class="fw-bold fs-5">Note on table talk</p>
        <p>As in most card games, players are not allowed to reveal the cards in their hands to partners or opponents. It is sometimes very tempting to offer advice or suggest moves to your partners, or to seek advice when it is your move. This kind of table talk almost inevitably gives away information about the cards held by the players, and is not allowed in games between experienced players.
        </p>
       <p>When teaching the game to beginners, this rule may be relaxed to allow possible moves to be discussed by the team. In this case, when discussing moves, players should do their best to avoid exchanging information about the cards that they hold.
       </p>
